          LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE I don't believe in an
          interventionist God But I know, darling, that you do But if I did I
          would kneel down and ask Him Not to intervene when it came to you Oh,
          not to touch a hair on your head Leave you as you are And if He felt
          He had to direct you Then direct you into my arms Into my arms, O Lord
          Into my arms, O Lord Into my arms, O Lord Into my arms And I don't
          believe in the existence of angels But looking at you I wonder if
          that's true But if I did I would summon them together And ask them to
          watch over you Or to each burn a candle for you To make bright and
          clear your path And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love And guide
          you into my arms Into my arms, O Lord Into my arms, O Lord Into my
          arms, O Lord Into my arms But I believe in Love And I know that you do
          too And I believe in some kind of path That we can walk down, me and
          you So keep your candles burning Make her journey bright and pure That
          she will keep returning Always and evermore Into my arms, O Lord Into
